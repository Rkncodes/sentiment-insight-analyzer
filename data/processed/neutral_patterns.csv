"Was taking this drug for herpes suppression.  It is recommended by some to take an antiviral for one year after the initial outbreak so as to have less outbreaks over one's lifetime.  I did get an outbreak while on the drug, however it was during a very stressful time so that is understandable.  Also, it is nice that only one dose is needed per day for most people. Side effects included mild hair loss (had much more hair loss on acyclovir), random dry heaving (retching) for no apparent reason, and headaches.  Although it seems that when I drink lots of water the headaches are fewer. Took one pill per day at the same time everyday.  It does and will stain things so be careful of the blue dye.",neutral,positive,mixed_sentiment,mixed_sentiment
"The treatment benefits were only temporary.  While it made sneezing and watery eyes diminish, it did not address the issue of respiratory difficulties.  I found that it may have even increased my respiratory symptoms in this process. I felt ditzy while on the drug and had a hard time sleeping.  I also felt the waves of how this drug would work and it was sometimes frustrating. I was to take one allegra per day to help alleviate pet allergies.",neutral,negative,mislabeled,mislabeled
carac got rid of the pre-cancerous spot and was not left with a scar burning eye by where it was applied. couldn't sleep well.

"I have good relief of sneezing, dripping nose, chesty cough, dry throat until a couple of months ago have been on citirizine for approximately 7 years if not more.  I saw my GP last week to change as the cetirizine was no longer working on my allergies.  Since then I have slept only for about 12 hours (in six days), a nauseous feeling in my stomach with dizziness, stomach cramps, a permanent knot in my stomach, shivers, tremors and sweats, I am worried about itching starting  now.  The good news is that I am less fuzzy in my head even though I am tired, my bladder control is back and I seem to be losing some of the 3/4 stones I have gained since taking the drug.  Today I took half a tablet just to function in my job I was prescribed one tablet daily along with eye drops and a nasal spray, over seven years ago.",neutral,positive,mixed_sentiment,mixed_sentiment
I became a happier person and felt like living and being active again. I was a better mother and wife. I could focus and was not lethargic or sad. The side effects mostly were related to low sex drive. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and then depression. I was treated first for the hypothyroidism and then the depression. The Zoloft worked but I still felt like I had a lower than normal energy level. My doctor added in the Wellbutrin to give me the energy boost.,neutral,positive,mixed_sentiment,mixed_sentiment
"there were none that I know. Still has osteroposis.  Had to stop because of the stomacjh effect. Developed atrial fibrillation of the heart.  going to shock heart into proper rhythm.  Looked down her throat with a camera to see if there was any blood clots around her heart.  Ruptured her esophagus.  Never did find out what caused this but i figure the fosamax caused a very very small hole in the esophagus, weakened the side and the camera scope tore a hole. When fixed, there was no more pain in the stomach.  She is alright now--but almost died from this See above for treatment details as I don't know what more I could say.  She is healthy now from this.  Fosamax and this type of drugs are not very good for some people.",neutral,negative,mixed_sentiment,mislabeled
"I noticed a significant improvement in my acne. I had painfully dry, irritated, and red skin for several months, as well as higher susceptibility to sunburn and visibly peeling, flaky skin... those first few months were the worst period of treatment. After a while, however, all the symptoms except for the peeling skin and sun sensitivity diminished. I applied a pea-sized amount of Tazorac cream once a night before bed, starting in my freshmen year in high school. I've been using Tazorac ever since (five years or so) because of the positive skin effects it's supposed to have.",neutral,positive,mixed_sentiment,mixed_sentiment
"I had two early stage miscarriages, so I was tested by a reproductive specialist. She diagnosed that I have high blood clot factor. As soon as the third pregnancy was confirmed (5th week), I stated to take Lovenox once a day. After reaching 13th week and ultrasound confirmed the baby is growing well, I was allow to be off Lovenox. I am now in third trimester and my pregnancy went well. There was no side effect, however I really hated giving injection to myself. I was so painfull. The injection spot became bruised, even though I iced it right away after injection. And the bruises did not heal for a week to two weeks. I picked different injection spot every day to avoid the bruised area, so my abdomen was purple for the 9 weeks. As memtioned above in treatment benefits, this drug was used to avoid recurrance of early stage miscarriage. The high blood clot factor originates from two reasons: for one my husband and I share two HLA, and two I have condition so called antiphospholipid syndrome. To reduce the factor I was directed to take baby asperin and Lovenox. Once I reached 13th week when the plecenta is well establised and growth of baby was well, my doctor decided Lovenox is no longer needed and baby asperin alone be fine onward.",neutral,positive,mixed_sentiment,mixed_sentiment

"i believe the medication did assist with depression. By the end of the six month most symptons of depression were gone when I was coming off the medication it was recommeded to do slowly by reducing the medication dosage gradually which i did.

"Moderate lifting of depressive episode, made it so I could function better in everyday life. None that I could detect. Nothing noticeable. Maybe just a bit more insomnia but I had that before taking Zoloft. I went to my internist and told him that I wanted to be put on a low dose of an antidepressant and something for my anxiety . I had been on Effexor for many years, awile ago. Effexor worked but the withdrawal symptoms were horrible, even if I so much as missed a dose. Perhaps it was a placebo effect, but I felt the Zoloft working after about a week. Nothing earth shattering,but noticeable.",neutral,positive,mixed_sentiment,mixed_sentiment
"Skin in certain areas (e.g. forehead, cheeks) sun damage became less noticeable. Fine lines have slightly improved. However fine lines on the lower eyelids have become worse. It was therefore, not used on fine lines on the lower eyelids the entire 1 year. I have used it approximately 4 months out of the 1 year in this area. It made it crease up and look wrinkled Dry skin. Flaky Skin. Breakouts during the first 6-8 weeks.
Irritation to my lips even though I do not apply it here. My lips feel sore by the next morning. Under eyes creasing up Renova applied once at nightime approx 20 minutes after cleansing.

"not noticable, supposed to clear all yeast from body because I had been feeling bloated, kept getting yeast infections and when I had colonics the lady told me that I had an abundance of yeast.  Makes sense cuz I drink a lot of beer and don't eat too healthy. none Take one tablet, once a day for two weeks.  I was also supposed to eat a lot of yogurt and take a pro biotic pill once and a while.  Affects were not noticible and I have no idea whether I really had yeast over growth and whether it did any thing beneficial or not.",neutral,negative,factual_objective,factual_objective
"Well, I had no babies. 

Also, skin was a bit clearer and breasts got about half a cup bigger (but that came with the rest of my body getting bigger, too). I gained 10 lbs in just a couple months, I had period munchies all the time, and could always eat. I felt uncomfortable turning down food and seemed to have a never-ending appetite. This would subside during the sugar pill week.

I suspect, but am not sure, that Yasmin also gave me some vaginal dryness. I had frequent painful sex, would get raw very easily, and actually got a tear inside my vagina from sex. If we went at it twice a day it seemed I would need a day or two break just to recover. (None of this has happened before, so the doctor suggested I move to a lower dose pill.) Take once a day at the same time everyday.",neutral,negative,mixed_sentiment,mixed_sentiment
Overall reduction in the severity of breakouts. Extreme fatigue. For the first week I became so tired that immediately after coming from work I'd go to bed. I cut back to one pill a day and have greatly improved. Haven't had the nerve to work back to 2 pills a day due to the last reaction. Take one pill after dinner. Wash face with medicated facewash.

"The treatment benefits was a minimal weight loss, but not nearly as much as I expected. I mainly experienced the following side effects: diarrhea, stomach cramps, indigestion, flatulence, oily stool, defecation urgency.

"I didn't get malaria Prescribed to my Husband and I on our Honeymoon in Vietnam and Cambodia.  On day 4 we both experienced waves of strong abdominal pain every hour or so accompanied by a need to go to the toilet with diarrhoea (but it was non-urgent need to go to the loo - like a normal upset tummy can be). Initially believing that it was a normal holiday tummy upset we starved ourselves for nearly 4 days (we were also not hungry) but the waves of pain did not significantly subside - triggered by drinking water.   We then arrived at a Hotel in Vietnam that had Internet access and looked at some lonelyplanet blogs - the advice on Malarone was to make sure to follow the medication instruction leaflet to the letter i.e. to take it with a ""milky"" drink.   We then began to take it at breakfast with as many dairy products as we could - yoghurt, cheese, milk on cereal etc, and the symptoms subsided.  The pain ceased after a couple of days but we continued to have violent, liquid bowel movements for another week...  
It would help if the leaflet explained why dairy is recommended - is it the fat that is required or the alkaline environment?",neutral,positive,mislabeled,mislabeled
"it's admittedly very good at preventing pregnancy...
because well...it kinda stops the urge to have it. constant back and stomach cramps,breakthrough bleeding(really often),it made my interest in sex really really low because I developed dyspareunia(painful intercourse) and it made me avoid sex which made me considerably depressed..and depression may or may not be a side effect..but it definitely was a thing. one shot every 4 months,it's fairly painless...
it's a great form of contraceptive.
because it basically makes you abstinent..the side effects just aren't worth it.",neutral,positive,mixed_sentiment,mislabeled
Exfoliates the skin. It is said to prevent or treat acne and acne scars. whether this is true is questionable. the drug induced some dryness and flakiness especially around the nose area and chin area. this side effect can go away after a while the product is a gel that is put on every night. it supposedly prevents new  blemishes and promotes exfoliation. the results for the blemishes were not satisfactory.,neutral,positive,mixed_sentiment,mixed_sentiment
Very rapid reduction in wheezing and coughing. Water retention under skin making it tender to touch including odd places like the back of the head. Feeling of raised body temperature and heat.

Other possible side effects are yet unknown as he has only recently discontinued use. Rash has yet to clear up after one week off the drug.

"The benefits were to eventually stop smoking. At first I experienced a slight headache and upset stomache. I was to take 1 small dosage pill twice a day for 1 week.

So far so good. Will know more after six month mark when x-rays are taken to see if pockets are closing. One area that was highly inflamed before the deep cleaning appears to be healing well. No inflammation there and more pink as opposed to the red color it was before. I was told yeast infections are a common side-effect with antibiotics. I noticed the beginnings of one after about four weeks so I started eating two 6 oz low-fat organic yogurts a day and I haven't had that problem again. one year low-dose doxycycline.

"The treatmeant benifits are that I showed a slight decrease in wrinkles. I really think that if used with other products it could be better. I also used sunscreen everyday. I really didn't see a difference in the sagging of the skin . I thought it would help with collagen production. I am continuing to use the product. I hope I see a difference. The side effects are dry skin. I can't wax my eyebrows without having the skin peeled off. I know they say to stop 3 days before you wax but it doesn't help. Also, living in florida, my skin became very sensitive to the sunlight. I also get a slight tingling when I apply my sunblock or lotion. I went to my doctor and asked for a wrinkle treatment. He give me some samples of the creame. He then wrote me out a year prescription of the creame. He told me to apply it twice a day but, if my skin becomes dry, to reduce it to one a day. I preceeded to do that and it stopped some of the dryness.",neutral,negative,mixed_sentiment,mixed_sentiment
"Benefits to taking Lipitor was that it helped reduce my total cholesterol numbers.  While that was a positive, the side-effects began to make me question the overall reduction in cholesterol numbers. When I first started taking Lipitor I did not notice any side effects.  Approx. three months into taking the drug, however, I started noticing upset stomach.  At first I thought perhaps the caffeine in my coffee was creating the upset as I started drinking more than one cup daily.  I cutback on the coffee and did not notice a difference in stomach issues.  Approximately 6-8 months into taking the drug, I began to experience some discomfort in the legs.  As a distance walker I analyzed my workout routine to see if I had added something different but had not.  I quit taking the drug 12 months (give or take) after starting. Treatment was simple:  take on tablet daily at bedtime.  The drug was (and did) to help reduce my overall cholesterol numbers.",neutral,negative,mixed_sentiment,mixed_sentiment
"i could sleep eventually due to long term insomnia. slow my thoughts down for the first 2 years. for the first couple years on 600mg it would totally knock me out and i liked it because i was exuasted and it slowed down my thoughts. but after that it began to have an adverse effect where once it kicked in i would have a mild to moderate anxiety attack, then i would have to eat to ease the anxiety as it would make me very hungry, then i could finally sleep. but not well and very disturbed and interupted. exessive binge eating and sleep walking. blocked nose, and fearful of thoughts. wanted to get off for the past few years. it was a catch 22 where i would feel extremely anxious ans hungry when i would have my dose. but if i didn't id feel even worse where i couldn't sleep and feel extremely aggitated and distressed. i recently come off of it which involved an admission to a psyc ward and was weened off in ten days which was way to quick. it was horrible but iv been mentally much better for the past 3 years and i was sick of all the side effects. getting off it after all these years was very hard and im currently taking diazapam temporarily until the withdrawls ease. my goal is to have natural sleeps. its very hard to get off, but now i feel that i am well enough it will be very worth the result. i needed it at the time i was prescibed it but hated taking it the whole time. it is a very strong drug and should be used with much caution.",neutral,positive,mixed_sentiment,mixed_sentiment
"The drug did lower the blood cholesterol effectively. The side effects included nightmares, muscle weakness, dizziness. 
In addition there were emotional disturbances. The drug was prescribed by a Cardiologist and was effective, however the side effects were considerable. After approximately one year the cholesterol LDL did drop and although this was positive, the side effects continued. After two years, the dosage was reduced to alternative days at the same daily dose.

"Analgesic post surgery without use of codeine (patient has allergy). Mild constipation While I found the medication moderately effective for pain relief, I seemed to build up a tolerance to it quickly, so that it had a progressively less pronounced effect over the course of a few days.

Con: Not useful as a long-term pain reducer because patient may eventually start taking more than the prescribed dosage to achieve pain relief.",neutral,positive,mixed_sentiment,mixed_sentiment
